# MonteCarlo

## Presentation
Simple abstract class to help performing Monte Carlo simulations in c++

## Note 
 Test of PIMC (Path Integral Monte Carlo) passed for harmonic oscillator coupled to harmonic bath
 
## Road Map
 * Tests (done)
 * MPI implementation (done) 
 * More robust i/o for saving results
 * Performance improvement
